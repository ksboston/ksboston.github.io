			<p>Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I am from Mexico City, where I obtained a B.A. in Political Science and International Relations from <a href='http://cide.edu'> CIDE (Center for Research and Teaching in Economics) </a>. My broad research interests are in the fields of political methodology and political behavior, with a special interest in survey methodology, computer vision, causal inference, and public opinion.</p>

			<p>My current research focuses on political methodology. One of my main projects involves the application of Marginal Structural Models to the estimation of controlled direct effects in PoliSci settings. Relatedly, I also have a piece regarding post-treatment control bias. My research interests also cover political behavior. I have working papers on personality stability and politics, perceptions of political control, ideology and bedrock values, and lifestyle differences and political polarization. I am also interested in developing tools and techniques to improve survey design and analysis. For example, I am part of the team that developed <a href='http://taps.wustl.edu/technical' target="_blank"> <tt>weightTAPSPACK</tt></a>, an R package that allows for dynamic weighting of <a href='http://taps.wustl.edu/' target="_blank"> The American Panel Survey (TAPS)</a>.</p>
