<p>I currently work for the Special School District of St. Louis County, where I am assigned to Fairview Primary School in the Jennings School District. I work with K-6 students with autism spectrum disorders. In a collaborative environment with paraprofessionals, behavior analysts, and parents, we work on teaching to students' academic, social, vocational, and self-care goals. Across students and pedagogical strategies, I strive to make data-informed decisions about what is best for each individual, especially by using Applied Behavior Analysis.</p>

<p>Previously, I was a teacher in the Missouri Schools for the Severely Disabled. There, I worked with older students; my priority was on building students' independent living skills. </p>

<p>In my teaching career, I have found that I have two passions. First, I regard individualized education as an imperative. All students deserve differentiated instruction tailored to their specific needs. Second, my goal is always to give students a voice. This has been particularly challenging - but also rewarding - in my autism-centered environments, where many students struggle to communicate. Making communication breakthroughs - verbal or otherwise - is extremely gratifying. The same can be said for general education classrooms, where it can be difficult to give every student the opportunity to speak her mind and to express her needs. </p>

<p>Before I moved to St. Louis, I worked in Buffalo, NY as a teacher's assistant, student teacher, clinician, and volunteer for six years. My last jobs was in a non-profit school for children with severe autism and other behavioral challenges. In 2013, I earned my Ed.M. in literacy education from the SUNY Buffalo, where I also worked in the Center for Literacy and Reading Instruction. Before that, I earned my BA (magna cum laude) from Niagara University in elementary and special education, and a concentration in literacy education.</p>
